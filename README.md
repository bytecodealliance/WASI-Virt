The virtualized component can be composed into a WASI Preview2 component with `wasm-tools compose`, providing fully-configurable WASI virtualization with host pass through or full encapsulation as needed.

Subsystem support:

- [x] Environment virtualization
- [ ] Filesystem virtualization

### Example

```rs
use std::fs;
use wasi_virt::WasiVirt;

fn main() {
    let virt_component_bytes = WasiVirt::new()
        // provide an allow list of host env vars
        .env_host_allow(&["PUBLIC_ENV_VAR"])
        // provide custom env overrides
        .env_overrides(&[("SOME", "ENV"), ("VAR", "OVERRIDES")])
        .create()
        .unwrap();
    fs::write("virt.component.wasm", virt_component_bytes).unwrap();
}
```

With the created `virt.component.wasm` component, this can now be composed into a component with the `wasm-tools compose` "definitions" feature:

```
wasm-tools compose mycomponent.wasm -d virt.component.wasm -o out.component.wasm
```

## CLI

A CLI is also provided in this crate supporting:

```
wasi-virt config.toml -o virt.wasm
```

With the configuration file format:

```
[env]
# Support all env vars on the final host (apart from the overrides)
# Set to "none" to entirely encapsulate the host env
host = "all"
# Always ensures that this env var and value is set
overrides = [["CUSTOM", "VAL"]]
```

Allow lists and deny lists can also be provided via:

```
[env.host]
allow = ["ENV_KEY"] # Or Deny = ...
```
